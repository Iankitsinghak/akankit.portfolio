  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p class="typing-text">
    I’m deeply passionate about programming, with a strong focus on C++, where I enjoy exploring its depth and versatility to solve real-world problems. Competitive programming is a big part of my journey—it pushes me to think critically, write efficient code, and constantly improve. I find joy in tackling complex problems and optimizing solutions, which has shaped me into a better problem solver over time. Alongside my interest in algorithms and data structures, I also enjoy frontend development, where I bring ideas to life through interactive and clean user interfaces. My background in discrete mathematics supports my logical thinking and helps me bridge the gap between theory and implementation. I'm always excited to learn, build, and take on new challenges in the world of tech.
